3. The tags that I found in the web page are: html, shadow, style, head, meta, link, title, body, center, table, tbody, tr, td script.
	html: this calls the base of the web page, it doesn't contain any information.
	shadow:  it was meant to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point, it's not usable in ordinary HTML
	style: that's the css file that contains all the visual description of the page or item of a page.
	head: this is the tab description, in chrome if we change the head text for example, the tab on top will change.
		meta: contains the metadata.
		link: contains a hyperlink to other page, also it has a description and can have an icon.
		title: this is the text that is shown in the tab.
	body: this contains all the contents of the web page, in this case it's a table.
		center: this is to get all the content of the body in the center of the page.
		table: adds a table to the web page.
		tbody: describes the table body.
			tr: short for table row, adds a row to the table that was created before.
			td: short for tabledefault allignment, it adds a stile to the row
			a: adds a reference to a text or link in this case, inside we can find the img tag, that adds an image to the link.
	script: calls a java script		
	
4. (index): this is the back bone of the page, I mean it contains all the information needed to form the page, the different styles and spaces.
	hn.js: this has all the functions that we can found in the page, it's a javascript and it makes the page works like it should.
	news.css: this is all the visual appearance of the page, for example the colors used and the different fonts.
	the following four files are .gif, this means that they're icons or images used in the page.
	

			
5. The xhr request it's better known as XMLHttpRequest and with this you can:
	Update a web page without reloading the page, Request data from the server, Receive data from the server	and send data to the server.
	if we see the xhr tab in the web page, we can see that the request takes aproximately 80 ms to complete.
